Years ago, monsters from the depths below took over the surface world. You and your family managed to esacpe to a safe village. Today, you wake up to sounds of screaming and cries for help. You quickly realize the monsters have found your safe haven. You run outside and discover your neighbor being attacked. You watch your neighbor scream in terror as a monster towers over him. The monsters are tearing apart your entire village, and you might be next if you don't escape now.
You see an opening out of your village where there's no monsters lurking. You sprint to escape your destroyed village, leaving behind your family, friends, and home. Not far into the woods, you see a creature lunge from behind the trees and attack another fleeing village.


You dash towards your neighbor. On the ground, you keenly notice a shiny pocket knife dropped by your neighbor. Careful to stay out of sight, you pick it up and get ready for your next decision.
In a show of heorism, you plunge the pocket knife into the distracted monster. The monster drops to the ground and releases your neighbor. The weak neighbor breaths his last breath and you look around your now devastated village. You can't help but reminance of a time of safety and prosperity.
You cast all of that behind, grab what you can, and flee into the wasteland. You fight the tears building up and try and focus on one thing: survival. Before all of this happened, you have heard about a village to the east and decide to head there. As dark sets, you feel your hunger growing and realize you only grabbed one food item before leaving.
As you keep on going, you hear a noise nearby and decide to inspect it. Getting closer you notice the sound came from a vial monster. He looks angry and dangerous, but maybe you should get a closer look.
You decide to not take any chances and plunge your trusty knife into the fiend. After the grueling battle, you notice a nest of baby creatures now orphaned by your horrible actions. You have no soul. You are scum... but seeing this has now made you feel reinvigorated. You can't help but wonder what it would be like to kill more.
Surveying the landscape for 'potential threats' you see another hostile creature minding his own business in the distance. Would it be so wrong to permanently prevent it from harming others in the future?
The thrill of the hunt enthralls you as you feel the life force drain from this horrible creature. You have never felt so alive before. Continuing on your journey, you notice a harmless infant monster with his siblings.
It's almost too easy. The screams remind you of the joyful music you listened to as as a kid. You can't help but scour for more things to relieve of their life on this world. Luckily it didn't take long for you to find the beloved village dog. He must have ran away.
Your smile never vanishes as you breathe in this creature's last breath. Continuing walking, all you can think about is the next hunt. Finally you find the village. Upon entering, a young woman is horrified by the amount of blood on your body. If only she knew it wasn't yours. You explain what happened to your village and they welcome you with open arms.
